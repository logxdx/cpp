**Documentation for QNA_tool Code:**

### Overview:
The provided code implements a Question-Answering (Q&A) tool based on a symbol table and a scoring mechanism for paragraphs. The tool processes sentences, extracts relevant information, scores paragraphs based on the frequency of words, and returns the top-k paragraphs for answering a given question.

### Components:

#### 1. SymNode Class:
   - Represents a node in the symbol table.
   - Contains information such as key (word), height, count, score, parent, left child, and right child.
   - Supports various rotation operations used in the AVL tree.

#### 2. SymbolTable Class:
   - Manages a symbol table using AVL trees to efficiently store and retrieve word frequencies.
   - Supports insertion, searching, and copying operations on the symbol table.

#### 3. QNA_tool Class:
   - Acts as the main interface for the Q&A tool.
   - Manages a 3D vector (`mainobj`) to store information about books, pages, paragraphs, and their respective symbol tables.
   - Provides methods for inserting sentences, scoring paragraphs, and obtaining the top-k paragraphs based on a given question.

#### 4. Utility Functions:
   - `maintainheight`: Recursively calculates and updates the height of a node in the AVL tree.
   - `balancefactor`: Calculates the balance factor of a node in the AVL tree.
   - `copyNodes`: Recursively copies nodes of a given tree.
   - `destroy`: Recursively frees the memory allocated for nodes in a tree.
   - `ppr`: Preprocesses a string into a vector of words, removing special characters and converting uppercase letters to lowercase.
   - `get_paragraph`: Retrieves a specific paragraph from a text file based on book code, page, and paragraph indices.
   - `heapify` and `heapSort`: Implements the heap sort algorithm for sorting paragraphs based on scores.

#### 5. QNA_tool Methods:
   - `insert_sentence`: Inserts a sentence into the tool's data structure, updating the symbol table.
   - `scoring`: Scores words in a sentence based on their frequency and external frequency data.
   - `score_paragraphs`: Scores paragraphs based on word frequencies and external frequency data.
   - `get_top_k_para`: Retrieves the top-k scored paragraphs for a given question.
   - `query`: Initiates the process of answering a question using the Q&A tool.
   - `query_llm`: Writes paragraphs and the question to files, invokes an external script for further processing, and receives the answer.

### External Dependencies:
   - The code assumes the existence of an external Python script (`<filename>`) for advanced processing (e.g., interacting with a language model).

### Usage:
   - Initialize an instance of `QNA_tool`.
   - Insert sentences using `insert_sentence`.
   - Score paragraphs with `score_paragraphs`.
   - Get top-k paragraphs for a question using `get_top_k_para`.
   - Execute a query using `query`.

### Important Notes:
   - Ensure external dependencies (e.g., Python script) are available and properly configured.
   - Pay attention to file paths and availability for reading and writing.

### Example:
```cpp
QNA_tool qna_tool;
qna_tool.insert_sentence(0, 1, 2, 3, "Sample sentence for testing.");
// ... (insert more sentences)
string question = "What is the meaning of life?";
qna_tool.query(question, "external_script.py");
```

### Further Improvements:
   - Error handling can be enhanced, especially in file operations and external script execution.
   - Documentation within individual functions can be improved for better clarity.
   - Consider modularizing the code further for better readability and maintainability.
   - Implement more sophisticated scoring mechanisms or use pre-trained language models for better results.

### Disclaimer:
   - Ensure compliance with external script usage policies and obtain necessary permissions.
   - Review and adapt the code based on specific use cases and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The QNA_tool code provides a foundation for building a simple Question-Answering system. Further customization and integration with advanced language models can enhance its capabilities for more accurate and context-aware responses.
